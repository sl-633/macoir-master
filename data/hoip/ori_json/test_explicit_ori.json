The AngII-AT1R axis also activates NF-\uff8e\uff7aB and disintegrin and metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17), which generates the mature form of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligands and TNF\uff8e\uff71, two NF-\uff8e\uff7aB stimulators (Eguchi et al., 2018). ADAM17 induction also processes the membrane form of IL-6R\uff8e\uff71 to the soluble form (sIL-6R\uff8e\uff71), followed by the gp130-mediated activation of STAT3 via the sIL-6R\uff8e\uff71-IL-6 complex in a variety of IL-6R\uff8e\uff71-negative nonimmune cells including fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and epithelial cells (Murakami et al., 2019). STAT3 is required for full activation of the NF-\uff8e\uff7aB pathway, and the main stimulator of STAT3 in vivo is IL-6, especially during inflammation, although there are nine other members of IL-6 family cytokines that can activate STAT3, at least in vitro (Murakami et al., 2019). Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 infection in the respiratory system can activate both NF-\uff8e\uff7aB and STAT3, which in turn can activate the IL-6 amplifier (IL-6 Amp), a mechanism for the hyper-activation of NF-\uff8e\uff7aB by STAT3, leading to multiple inflammatory and autoimmune diseases (Murakami et al., 2019).",

Importantly, in an autopsy study of 159 patients with ARDS, fibrosis was noted in three (4%) of 82 patients with a disease duration of less than 1 week, 13 (24%) of 54 patients with a disease duration of between weeks 1 and 3, and 14 (61%) of 23 patients with a disease duration of greater than 3 weeks, suggesting that to be effective, any potential antifibrotic intervention should be considered within the first week of ARDS onset. A substantial proportion of patients who develop ARDS will experience residual long-term impairment of lung function and CT evidence of pulmonary fibrosis, with anterior reticulation the dominant abnormality in as many as 85% of survivors. Multiple aberrant host pathways interconnect to result in pulmonary fibrosis in a subset of individuals who develop ARDS. Important mediators include the dysregulated release of matrix metalloproteinases during the inflammatory phase of ARDS, which causes epithelial and endothelial injury and unchecked fibroproliferation. Canonical profibrotic pathways regulated by TGF-beta are important, and there is evidence that vascular dysfunction is a key component of the switch from ARDS to fibrosis, with VEGF and cytokines such as IL-6 and TNFalpha implicated. In fatal cases of COVID-19, pulmonary fibrosis is generally present at autopsy, with anecdotal reports of severe fibrotic organising pneumonia. In some cases, abnormal immune mechanisms initiate and promote pulmonary fibrosis, possibly as a consequence of a cytokine storm.",
